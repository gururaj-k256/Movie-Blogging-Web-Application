                    An ode to college-time friendships, romances, ragging, fights, competitions and countless memories,
                     Chhichhore is a riot of emotions, and takes you on a nostalgic ride. It’s a relevant film with a rather important message conveyed through 
                     an engaging narrative. Directed by Nitesh Tiwari of Dangal fame, Chhichhore is high on content and humour packaged so well that it
                      stays with you for a very long time.The story is simple — a bunch of engineering students and their journey from being losers to choosers.
                     Sushant Singh Rajput (Annirudh) and Shraddha Kapoor (Maya) play a divorced couple, and they have a reunion of sorts with their college
                      buddies, though in rather unwanted circumstances. Together, they recall and relive their old college memories, the good and bad days spent
                       almost 20 years ago. The screenplay takes a trip down memory lane through college hostels, sports grounds and canteen conversations; 
                     switch to present day and you see the same camaraderie in their friendship that was forged in college.
