                    <br>Go ahead, watch this film and relive nostalgia from your college days.<br>
                    Kirik Party is the story of a gang of mischievous students, led by the protagonist Karna (Rakshit Shetty), 
                    who have just joined an engineering college. They belong to different streams of engineering but develop 
                    a bond while staying together in the hostel. The treatment is stylish with light humour throughout while exploring
                     the college life of these youngsters. Karna, the protagonist from a small town has joined this engineering college and 
                     he gangs up with his hostel mates Loki, Alexander, Manja and others to fuel a lot of mischief in the college. During the
                     first year he befriends Saanvi (Rashmika Mandanna) a Final year student and certain incidents impacts Karna's 
                     life making him question his very basic thought process.<br>Every character leaves a distinct impression on you which adds up to form
                      your cumulative opinion on the film. The second half of the film is a bit long and could have been a bit more brisker and 
                     crispier but the way it ends more than makes up for those dull moments (if any) in the second half.
                     The beauty of the film is in how you can relate to the film even if you have had a way more boring college life than the
                      protagonist and his group of friends have in the film. The movie succeeds in making you go into that mode of remembrance and nostalgia.
                     The music comfortably enhances these emotions and it is worth watching the movie twice just for its wonderful music. 
                     The movie begins and ends with the same song but leaves us gasping for breath with contrasting emotions.
